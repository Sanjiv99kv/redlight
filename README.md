# RedLight Start Game üèéÔ∏è

A web-based reaction time game built with React, TypeScript, and Vite that simulates the thrilling experience of an F1 racing start. Test your reflexes by hitting the accelerator as soon as the red lights go out!

## About the Game

RedLight Start is inspired by the Formula 1 starting procedure. In an F1 race, drivers must wait for five red lights to go out before they can start - react too early and you get a penalty, react too late and you lose positions. This game recreates that pressure-filled moment and measures your reaction time down to the millisecond.

## How to Play

1. Click the "START" button to begin the game
2. Watch the video sequence of lights
3. When the lights go out, tap the accelerator button as quickly as possible
4. Your reaction time will be displayed in seconds
5. Share your score with friends or try again to beat your best time
